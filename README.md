# tictactwo
Tic-tac-two is a modified and more complex version of the classic Tic-tac-toe game with a larger board, movable grid and buttons. In this project: I practised C#, learned code structuring, built a system to share game saving/loading logic between a database and JSON. The game logic runs in both the console and C# Razor Pages.
