# tictactwo
Tic-tac-two is a modified and more complex version of the classic Tic-tac-toe game. It features a larger board, movable grid and buttons. 
In this project, I practised C# skills and learned how to structure code effectively. 
I also implemented a system that allows game-saving and loading logic to be shared between a database and JSON files. The game logic runs in both the console and C# Razor Pages.
The game can also be played against a AI, which can calculate winning or blocking move. A custom game can be made with your desired game settings.
